# 🌫️ Analysis of Air Pollution Across India

This repository presents my project **“Analysis of Air Pollution Across India”**, where I conducted an in-depth **spatiotemporal and statistical analysis** of PM₁₀ pollution levels across Indian states.  
This work reflects my ability to apply **data science and visualization techniques** to address real-world **environmental and public health challenges**.

## ✨ My Contribution

- Designed and implemented a complete **data analysis pipeline** - from **data cleaning and transformation** to **statistical modeling and visualization**.  
- Conducted **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to identify spatial and temporal pollution patterns.  
- Built **ARIMA/SARIMA** models to forecast PM₁₀ concentrations in selected states.  
- Applied **Bayesian spatial analysis** (INLA + SPDE) for estimating pollution across geography.  
- Investigated relationships between **air pollution and mortality rates** using **GLM/GAM** models.  
- Created **visual dashboards and reports** for effective communication of insights.

## 📊 Data Sources

- **Air Pollution Data:** [Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), India](https://cpcb.nic.in/)  
- **Health Data:** [Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME)](https://www.healthdata.org/)  

---

## 📈 Key Insights

- **Northern India** exhibited consistently higher PM₁₀ concentrations compared to southern regions.  
- **Kerala and Tamil Nadu** maintained relatively lower pollution levels throughout the years.  
- **Winter months** recorded the highest pollution due to limited atmospheric dispersion.  
- Time-series forecasts indicated a **declining trend** in some states, suggesting gradual improvement.  
- Statistical analysis revealed **notable correlations between PM₁₀ and mortality rates**, emphasizing the public health burden of air pollution.

## 🔮 Future Scope

If extended, the study could:
- Include additional pollutants such as **PM₂.₅, NO₂, and SO₂** for a holistic view.  
- Integrate **meteorological, demographic, and socioeconomic factors** for richer models.  
- Compare traditional statistical models with **machine learning algorithms** (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost).  
- Conduct **policy impact analyses** to evaluate the effectiveness of pollution control measures.
