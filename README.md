# Analysis of Air Pollution Across India

This repository showcases my project **"Analysis of Air Pollution Across India"**, where I carried out a detailed spatiotemporal and statistical study of PM10 pollution levels across Indian states.  
The project reflects my ability to apply advanced data science methods to real-world environmental and public health challenges.

---

## ✨ My Contribution
- Designed and implemented a complete data analysis pipeline, from **data cleaning and imputation** to **statistical modeling** and **interpretation**.
- Applied **Bayesian spatial modeling (INLA + SPDE)** to estimate pollution levels across geography.
- Built **ARIMA/SARIMA time-series models** to forecast PM10 concentrations in selected states.
- Used **GLM/GAM statistical modeling** to study associations between air pollution and mortality rates.
- Produced clear visualizations to communicate complex results effectively.

## 📊 Data Sources
- **Air Pollution Data**: Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), India  
- **Health Data**: Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME)  

*For confidentiality, the raw datasets are not included here — only placeholders are provided.*

## 🔎 Key Insights
- Northern India consistently showed **higher PM10 pollution**, while southern states like Kerala had much lower levels.
- Seasonal patterns revealed that **pollution peaks during winter months** due to limited pollutant dispersal.
- Time-series models highlighted both **decreasing trends** (e.g., Tamil Nadu) and **increasing trends** (e.g., Jammu & Kashmir).
- Statistical modeling showed **significant relationships between PM10 and mortality** in some states, emphasizing the health risks.

## 🔮 Future Scope
If extended, I would:
- Analyze **PM2.5 and other pollutants** for a more detailed health impact assessment.
- Integrate **meteorological and socio-economic variables** to enrich the models.
- Compare statistical approaches with **machine learning methods** (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost).
- Explore **policy impact evaluation** to measure the effectiveness of pollution control measures.

## 🌍 Why This Matters
Air pollution remains a critical issue in India, with direct implications for **public health and economic well-being**.  
This project demonstrates how **data-driven analysis** can generate insights to support **policy-making**, **urban planning**, and **sustainable development**.  

It highlights my skills in:
- Advanced statistical modeling  
- Handling real-world, imperfect datasets  
- Translating data into meaningful insights  
- Communicating results clearly to both technical and non-technical audiences
